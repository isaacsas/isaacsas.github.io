    "summary": "My research interests are in the areas of numerical analysis, mathematical biology, and mathematical physics, with an emphasis on the development and the numerical analysis of methods for studying problems in cell biology. Recent research areas have included understanding the rigorous coarse-grained limits of particle stochastic reaction-diffusion models, developing accurate and efficient numerical methods for the simulation of such models within realistic cellular geometries, and the application of particle reactive transport models to the study of cell signaling, T cell signaling, and antibody-antigen interactions.",
