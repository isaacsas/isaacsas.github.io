My research interests are in the areas of numerical analysis, mathematical
biology, and mathematical physics, with an emphasis on the development and the
numerical analysis of methods for studying problems in cell biology. Recent
research areas have included understanding the rigorous coarse-grained limits
of particle stochastic reaction-diffusion models, developing accurate and
efficient numerical methods for the simulation of such models within realistic
cellular geometries, and the application of particle reactive transport models
to the study of cell signaling, T cell signaling, and antibody-antigen
interactions. For the latter I have helped to develop new combined experimental,
modeling, and inference approaches to better estimate from experimental data the
biophysical parameters that drive antibody-antigen and ligand-receptor
interactions.
